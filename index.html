          <h2>HTML - HyperText Markup Language</h2>
          <p>HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet.</p> 

          <p>It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the » W3C, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.</p>

          <p>HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page.</p>

          <p class="text-center"><img class="rounded-circle" src="img/css3-md-rnd.png" alt="CSS3" width="140" height="140"></p>
          <h2>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
          <p>CSS is a style language that defines layout of HTML documents. For example, CSS covers fonts, colours, margins, lines, height, width, background images, advanced positions and many other things. Just wait and see!</p>

          <p>HTML can be (mis-)used to add layout to websites. But CSS offers more options and is more accurate and sophisticated. CSS is supported by all browsers today.</p>

          <p>CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want. Pages load faster − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-3">
          <p class="text-center"><img class="rounded-circle" src="img/wp-md.png" alt="Wordpress" width="140" height="140"></p>
          <h2>WordPress</h2>
          <p>WordPress started in 2003 with a single bit of code to enhance the typography of everyday writing and with fewer users than you can count on your fingers and toes. Since then it has grown to be the largest self-hosted blogging tool in the world, used on millions of sites and seen by tens of millions of people every day.</p>

          <p>Everything you see here, from the documentation to the code itself, was created by and for the community. WordPress is an Open Source project, which means there are hundreds of people all over the world working on it. (More than most commercial platforms.)</p>

          <p>It also means you are free to use it for anything from your recipe site to a Fortune 500 web site without paying anyone a license fee and a number of other important freedoms.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-3">
          <p class="text-center"><img class="rounded-circle" src="img/bootstrap-md-rnd.png" alt="Bootstrap 4" width="140" height="140"></p>
          <h2>Bootstrap - Versions 3 & 4</h2>
          <p>Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end component library.  Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter, and released as an open source product in August 2011 on GitHub. In June 2014 Bootstrap was the No.1 project on GitHub!</p>

          <p>Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.</p>

          <p>If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery</p>
